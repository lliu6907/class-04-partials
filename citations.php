      <p>
        <strong>Citing External Resources:</strong> Please cite any resources you <em>use</em> or <em>reference</em>
        that <strong>you did not create yourself <em>specifically</em> for this class</strong> (external resource). The
        citation must be public (i.e. visible in the browser) and near the resource. <strong>There is no required
          citation format.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Citing Internal Resources:</strong> For resources that <strong>you created <em>specifically</em> for
          this class</strong>, you don't need to cite them publicly (i.e. visible in the browser), but <strong>you do
          need to let us know you created it in a comment <em>near</em> the resource in the code</strong> (so we know
        you didn't forget to cite them.)
      </p>
